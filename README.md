Getting Started:

To run this application, you'll need to get an API key from The Movie Database (TMDB) and add it to the project.

    Get Your TMDB API Key:

        Go to https://www.themoviedb.org/signup and create an account if you don't have one.

        Once logged in, navigate to your profile settings, then to the "API" section.

        Request a new API key (Developer/v3).

    Add API Key to Project:

        Open the project in Android Studio.

        Locate the MovieViewModel.kt file.

        Find the line private val API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" (or similar).

        Replace "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" with your actual TMDB API key.

That's it! Build and run the application on your Android device or emulator.
